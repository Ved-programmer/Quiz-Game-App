* ## Overall Description

    <ul>

    The game would have a start screen detailing the overall main instructions of the game. A button would be present to go the game page, the game page would have information such as the quiz title, number of questions etc. 
    
    When the user starts the quiz then each question would appear for a limited time which would be unique for each question, the user has to answer the question in that time otherwise the user would get no points. the time would be indicated by a timer which the user would be able to see. When a question is shown to the user to when the user answers the question would be called a session, in each session the question would be displayed along with the options, the amount of options would vary based on each question. 
    
    When the question ends(either by the time being over or the user marking the answer) then if the user has marked the correct answer then the user would get a point otherwise(if the user marked the wrong answer or didn't mark the answer and ran out of time) 0 points would be given, the user would also be able to see the correct answer after each question. 
    
    Once all the sessions are done then the user would be able to see the final score, the high score ever scored by the user.
